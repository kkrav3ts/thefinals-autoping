# THE FINALS Auto-Clicker Tools

Level up your gameplay with smart automation. Three lightweight tools designed for THE FINALS that give you a competitive edge — without touching game files.

## 🎯 Auto-Ping

**Never miss a callout again.** Hold right-click to aim, and enemies get pinged automatically every second. Perfect for solo queue where communication wins games.

### Why use it?

- 🏆 **Win more fights** — Your team always knows where enemies are
- 🎮 **Zero effort** — Just aim like you normally would
- 🤝 **Solo queue friendly** — Communicate without a mic

---

## 🔫 Auto-Shot

**Maximize your fire rate.** Transforms any semi-auto or burst weapon into a consistent clicking machine with human-like timing. Hold left mouse button and let the tool do the clicking.

### Why use it?

- ⚡ **Faster firing** — Consistent clicks without finger fatigue
- 🎯 **Better accuracy** — Focus on aiming, not clicking
- 🕹️ **Natural timing** — Randomized delays that feel human

## ⏱️ Delay Checker

**Measure your click timing.** A simple diagnostic tool that displays the duration of your left mouse button clicks in milliseconds. Useful for testing your mouse, analyzing your click patterns, or calibrating the Auto-Shot tool.

### Auto-Shot Setup

This tool requires a quick one-time setup in your game settings.

#### Step 1: Change your in-game primary firing key

1. Open THE FINALS -> **Settings** -> **Keybinds**.
2. Change **Primary Fire** from `Left Mouse Button` to any keyboard key (e.g., `L`)
3. Apply and close settings

#### Step 2: First launch

1. **Run** `thefinals-autoshot.exe`
2. **Press** the same keyboard key you mapped for **Primary Fire** in-game.
3. The tool will confirm your selection

#### Step 3: Optional reconfiguration

- Pressing `F1` anytime resets the tool and enables you to reconfigure both the trigger key and the shooting key.
- Press `F13` anytime to pause auto-shooting.

#### Step 4: Play!

- **Hold `Mouse 1`** or the trigger key you set shoot - the tool rapidly presses your mapped firing key
- Release the trigger key to stop shooting

| Action  | Key                  |
|---------|----------------------|
| Trigger | `Mouse 1` by default |
| Shoot   | Your selected key    |
| Rebind  | `F1`                 |
| Pause   | `F13`                |

> **Tip:** This works great with semi-auto weapons like pistols, revolvers, or burst weapons!

### Delay Checker Setup

1. **Run** `thefinals-delaychecker.exe`
2. **Click** the left mouse button anywhere
3. **See** the click duration displayed in milliseconds

```
Monitoring left mouse button clicks...
Press and release the left mouse button to see the delay.
Click delay: 87 ms
Click delay: 112 ms
Click delay: 95 ms
```

> **Tip:** Use this to understand your natural click timing before configuring Auto-Shot!

## ✅ Safe to Use

All tools are **external** and work by monitoring/simulating keyboard inputs. They:

- ❌ Do NOT read game memory
- ❌ Do NOT modify game files
- ❌ Do NOT inject into the game process
- ✅ Work like a hardware macro keyboard
