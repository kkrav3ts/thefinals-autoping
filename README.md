# THE FINALS Auto-Clicker Tools

Level up your gameplay with smart automation. Three lightweight tools designed for THE FINALS that give you a competitive edge — without touching game files.

## 🎯 Auto-Ping

**Never miss a callout again.** Hold right-click to aim, and enemies get pinged automatically every second. Perfect for solo queue where communication wins games.

### Why use it?

- 🏆 **Win more fights** — Your team always knows where enemies are
- 🎮 **Zero effort** — Just aim like you normally would
- 🤝 **Solo queue friendly** — Communicate without a mic

## 🔫 Auto-Shot

**Maximize your fire rate.** Transforms any semi-auto or burst weapon into a consistent clicking machine with human-like timing. Hold left mouse button and let the tool do the clicking.

### Why use it?

- ⚡ **Faster firing** — Consistent clicks without finger fatigue
- 🎯 **Better accuracy** — Focus on aiming, not clicking
- 🕹️ **Natural timing** — Randomized delays that feel human

## ⏱️ Delay Checker

**Measure your click timing.** A simple diagnostic tool that displays the duration of your left mouse button clicks in milliseconds. Useful for testing your mouse, analyzing your click patterns, or calibrating the Auto-Shot tool.

### Why use it?

- 🔬 **Debug your setup** — Verify your mouse is registering clicks correctly
- 📊 **Analyze patterns** — See how long you hold clicks on average
- 🛠️ **Calibrate tools** — Fine-tune Auto-Shot timing based on your click behavior

## 📖 How to Use

### Auto-Ping Setup

1. **Run** `thefinals-autoping.exe`
2. **Press** the keyboard key you use for pinging in-game (e.g., `Z` or `X`)
3. **Play!** Hold right-click (aim) and enemies get pinged automatically

| Action  | Key                      |
|---------|--------------------------|
| Trigger | Right Mouse Button (Aim) |
| Ping    | Your selected key        |

### Auto-Shot Setup

This tool requires a quick one-time setup in your game settings:

#### Step 1: Change your in-game shoot key

1. Open THE FINALS → **Settings** → **Keybinds**
2. Change **"Fire"** from `Left Mouse Button` to any keyboard key (e.g., `L`)
3. Apply and close settings

#### Step 2: Configure the tool

1. **Run** `thefinals-autoshot.exe`
2. **Press** the same key you just mapped for shooting (e.g., `L`)
3. The tool will confirm your selection

#### Step 3: Play!

- **Hold Left Mouse Button** to shoot — the tool rapidly presses your mapped key
- Release to stop shooting

| Action  | Key                      |
|---------|--------------------------|
| Trigger | Left Mouse Button (Hold) |
| Shoot   | Your selected key        |

> **Tip:** This works great with semi-auto weapons like pistols, revolvers, or burst weapons!

### Delay Checker Setup

1. **Run** `thefinals-delaychecker.exe`
2. **Click** the left mouse button anywhere
3. **See** the click duration displayed in milliseconds

```
Monitoring left mouse button clicks...
Press and release the left mouse button to see the delay.
Click delay: 87 ms
Click delay: 112 ms
Click delay: 95 ms
```

> **Tip:** Use this to understand your natural click timing before configuring Auto-Shot!

## ✅ Safe to Use

All tools are **external** and work by monitoring/simulating keyboard inputs. They:

- ❌ Do NOT read game memory
- ❌ Do NOT modify game files
- ❌ Do NOT inject into the game process
- ✅ Work like a hardware macro keyboard
