# THE FINALS Auto-Ping

A lightweight Windows utility that automatically pings enemies while you're aiming in THE FINALS. It greatly improves communication within the team and helps you win more games even in solo queue.

✅ This tool does not depend on THE FINALS game process, hence the integrity of the game is untouched. 

## Demo

![Demo](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bff17d8c-ceb6-458f-b3ba-b447ce5a8e2a)

## How It Works

When you hold the **right mouse button** (aim down sights), the tool automatically presses **Left Control** (ping) for you:

1. **Initial press** — Pings immediately when you start aiming
2. **Repeat** — Continues to ping every 1 second while you hold right-click
3. **Release** — Stops when you release the right mouse button

This keeps enemies marked without interrupting your aim.
