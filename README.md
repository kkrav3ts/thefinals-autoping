## ✨ Features

- **Auto-ping while aiming** — Hold right-click, enemies get pinged automatically
- **Repeating pings** — Keeps pinging every second while you aim
- **Lightweight** — Minimal CPU usage, runs quietly in the background
- **Safe** — Does not modify game files or interact with the game process

3. Run it — no installation needed

> **Note:** Windows only.

## 📖 Usage

1. Run the executable
2. When prompted, press the keyboard(!) key you want to use for pinging (this should match your in-game ping key)
3. The tool will confirm which key was selected
4. Hold right-click (aim) in-game to automatically ping enemies every second

## 🛠️ Advanced: Build from Source

For developers who want to compile from source:

**Requirements:** [Go 1.25+](https://golang.org/dl/)

```bash
# Windows
go build -o autoping.exe main.go

# macOS / Linux (cross-compile)
GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 go build -o autoping.exe main.go
```

**Customization:** 
- To change the aim trigger key, modify the `aimKey` variable in `main.go` (line 80). Default is `0x02` (Right Mouse Button).
- The ping key is selected at runtime, but you can modify the `keyNames` map to add/remove supported keys.
- Timing intervals can be adjusted in the `main()` function (lines 83-85).
